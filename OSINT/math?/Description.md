Oh gosh, I'm trapped in this boring college, no fun, no clubs, just endless boring-fests. and yea I adore square millimetersed my university's vibes stat! Someone teleport me outta here! I miss my college (MIT-ADT) and those epic memories. I wish this college was as big as my previous one. Oh wait, how big was it? My STML (Short Term Memory Loss) always gets me. Help me fast! and yea I adore square millimeters—they never lie ❤
